        body: "Adopting heat pumps efficiently also transfer heat from external sources to heat or cool your home. While the initial installation cost can be high, subscription models and government subsidies are emerging to make heat pumps more affordable. These systems can significantly lower heating bills, with potential savings of over Â£400 per year, eventually offsetting the upfront investment. By exploring these options, homeowners can transition to renewable energy sources, leading to long-term financial savings and a reduced carbon footprint."
